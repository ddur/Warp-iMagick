How to contribute?

Install, use, register for automatic updates and please recommend Warp-iMagick plugin to your contacts.

Any feedback is contribution in the form or reporting Issues/Bugs or opening Discussions/Questions is very welcome.

Translating plugin strings, titles, messages etc is very velcome.

In the process ot the commiting and releasing, some code is transformed to comply with WordPress Code Standards (ie. translation variables) and irrelevant development comments are removed (except comments intended for documentation and doc-comments). This repository is just a transformed mirror of the private Git Repository. Consequently, there is no way to accept PR and merge it to original code, so please do not send Pull Request for the code. Translations are welcome as PR because they are in directory (/languages) separated from the code.

Thank you.
