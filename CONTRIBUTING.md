How to contribute?

Install, use, register for automatic updates and please recommend Warp-iMagick plugin to your contacts.

All contribution feedback in the form or reporting Issues/Bugs or opening Discussions/Questions is very welcome.

In the process ot the commiting and releasing, some code is transformed to comply with WordPress Code Standards (ie. translation variables) and irrelevant development comments are removed (except comments intended for documentation and doc-comments). This repository is just a transformed mirror of the private Git Repository. Consequently, there is no way to accept PR and merge it to original code, so please do not send Pull Request.

Thank you.
