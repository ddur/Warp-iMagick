Contibutions by reporting Issues or opening Discussions are very welcome.

In the process ot the commiting and releasing, some code is transformed to comply with WordPress Code Standards (ie. translation) and development comments are removed (except doc-comments). This repository is just a transformed mirror of the private Git Repository.

Consequently, there is no way to accept PR and merge it to original code, so please do not send Pull Request.

Thank you.
