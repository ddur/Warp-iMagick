Optimize Images On-Site. No Cloud-Service/Signup. Convert to WebP On Upload/Regenerate. Resize Uploads. Set Sharpness, Quality & Big-Image-Threshold.

== Description ==

* **NEW: Tested with WP 6.0 Beta 3 (26 April 2022). Plugin updates are now served from [Updates Server](https://warp-imagick.pagespeed.club/) (NOT from WordPress.org).**
Check & Update (one-click or enable auto-update) from your site admin Dashboard requires Update Password. Login on Updates Server to manage Free Update Passwords in your User Profile.


* **NEXT: 2.+ VERSION: WebP On Demand (on-the-fly) Convert JPEG/PNG images to WebP for the whole site.**
When modern (WebP enabled) browser request for JPEG/PNG image, if WebP Clone does not exists, plugin will respond with On Demand (on-the-fly) converted WebP Clone.
Converted WebP Clone images will be permanently available for subsequent requests. Anywhere on the site, including images in Media, WP Core, Plugins, Themes, etc. As on Theme, Plugin and Core updates, directories are removed and replaced with newer version, converted WebP Clones are removed along. New WebP Clones are again created on the first demand/request.
You don't have to, but still, you may regenerate old Media for better compression and sharpness of JPEG images, with or without generating WebP Clones.


* **Warp iMagick | Optimize Images: EASY to use, PRIVATE and FREE.**
Install, activate, configure and start uploading new media images. To bulk (re)compress existing media images use ["Regenerate Thumbnails Plugin"](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) or ["WP CLI media regenerate" command](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/media/regenerate/).
Image Optimization is performed on-site, free and at the "expense" of your site hosting provider. No limits in number or megabytes of optimized images. Plugin uses only PHP software installed on your server. By PHP-imagick and PHP-GD (PHP extensions). No external cloud/service or signup required.


* **Warp iMagick | Convert WebP: enables your site to serve images in next-gen formats.**
Original upload JPEG/PNG images are copied into compressed & optimized JPEG/PNG/WebP media types of original size and subsizes/thumbnails. WebP images are served by default. JPEG/PNG images are served only for older (NO-WebP compatible) browsers.


* **Warp iMagick | Image Compression Quality: flexible, easy to configure.**
Set JPEG/WebP compression quality % / image file-size ratio that best suits your WordPress site needs. Smaller compression quality results in smaller image file-size and faster page load.


* **Warp iMagick | Sharpen Image: enables you to sharpen blurry WordPress subsize/thumbnail images.**
Original JPEG/PNG images are copied into compressed & optimized JPEG/PNG/WebP media types, of original size and subsizes/thumbnails. WebP images are served by default. Original & optimized JPEG/PNG images are served only for older, NO-WebP compatible, browsers.


* **Warp iMagick | Resize on Uploads: enables you to set limit for Big image geometry, reduce file size and save disk space.**
Original big JPEG/PNG images are (optionally) resized to your image maximum geometry (configurable) limit. Replacing original upload image and saving your disk-space, when enabled. When site target is mobile or tablet, you may want to limit uploads to maximal/largest image size (780-1024) fot the target device.


* **Warp iMagick | Image Optimizer: gives you full control over image optimization, compression quality and file size.**
Images optimization is customizable along with other advanced image optimization & compression settings. See all options used to optimize images in the plugin **Settings** page.


* **After activation, settings you may want to change are JPEG Compression Quality and Sharpen blurry WordPress subsize/thumbnail images.**
Set your image compression quality from 30% to 95%. As recommended in video below, plugin default JPEG Compression Quality of 60% is good speed/file-size/quality compromise for most of the web sites. If not, choose your own best compression settings. Sharpen JPEG Image from 0.5 to 1.5 Sigma. For the rest of the settings, use defaults [(some recommended by Google)](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeImages#optimizations-for-gif,-png,-and-jpeg-images) or feel free to experiment and have fun with. üòá

* **You don't have to resize or optimize images before uploading.**
Warp iMagick image optimizer plugin will do it for you and preserve your uploaded [or automatically resized] high quality original image as source for multiple re-compressions. Never ever over-compress or loose thumbnail quality.


* **Fastest and most comprehensive serving of converted WebP images ...**
... is achieved by your server software (not by slow PHP). Transparent serving WebP clones instead original JPEG/PNG uploads (for WebP enabled browsers) covers all image links: in HTML code, in CSS code (styles) and in JavaScript code. You do not have to rewrite HTML <img>, nor your (background image) CSS styles, nor dynamically invoked images via Java Script. Serving WebP images with [Apache Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) requires simple manual (DIY) modification of .htaccess file. Use [**WP Htaccess Editor Plugin**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-htaccess-editor/) to safely modify (copy&paste) your Apache .htaccess configuration file. You will find instructions on how to configure server and deliver WebP images on the settings page. Click on **HELP** at the top right of the plugin **SETTINGS PAGE**. If you use [WordOps - Free WordPress sites Nginx stack & control CLI for VPS or Dedicated servers)](https://wordops.net/), your [Nginx Server](https://nginx.org/en/) is already [configured](https://github.com/WordOps/WordOps) to serve WebP clones instead original JPEG/PNG uploads & subsizes/thumbnails, but restricted to "wp-content/uploads/" directory only.


* **Improve your site speed, performance and [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) or [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) score and SEO ranking ...**
... by serving better compressed and next generation image formats (JPEG/PNG/WebP). When generating WebP images is enabled, every JPEG and PNG media image or thumbnail found during image optimization process is converted to WebP and saved as copy with .webp extension added. Default PNG&JPEG to WebP image compression quality is 75% (configurable). In addition, JPEG to WebP compression quality can be set to use & follow compression quality set for JPEG images.


* **Automatic image optimization to subsizes/thumbnails and conversion to WebP images:**
Compress image files more or keep higher image quality than WordPress image optimization does for subsizes/thumbnails. Compress images automatically on upload or on "regenerate thumbnails". Uploaded image is always preserved in original state. Image Compression will always start from original image quality. You can't "overoptimize" or "overcompress". Reoptimize existing images with ["Regenerate Thumbnails plugin"](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) single or batch process, or with ["WP CLI media regenerate" command](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/media/regenerate/).


* **Generate & Convert WebP images (optional)**
JPEG image optimization is speed & pagespeed/SEO score efficient even without WebP. Because plugin has advanced JPEG image compression capabilities, not available in WordPress original image optimization.


* **Image optimization is compatible with ["WP CLI media regenerate" command](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/media/regenerate/) and/or with ["Regenerate Thumbnails" plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/).**
**Important Note:** Since WordPress 5.3, BIG JPEG images reduced to 2560x2560 (by "Big Image Size Threshold" feature) and then manually edited by user, on regenerate, will be restored back to original (unedited) version. User edited modifications will be lost, unless this plugin is used. See [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Automattic/regenerate-thumbnails/issues/102). Same bug/issue applies both to ["WP CLI media regenerate" command](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/media/regenerate/) and ["Regenerate Thumbnails plugin"](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/). To fix that bug/issue, install or upgrade Warp iMagick plugin to version 1.6.2 or above.


* **Compatible up to PHP 8.1.* and tested against WP (PHP 7.4) coding standards.**
Tested with [PHP_CodeSniffer (phpcs)](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) using [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/php/) [GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards) rules and [PHPCompatibility ](https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility) rules.


* **Multisite support**
Designed to work on WP multisite. No known reason to fail on WP multisite, but not extensively tested yet! Please, let us know if you find any incompatibility with WP multisite.


* **Clean uninstall**
By default, no plugin settings are left in your database after uninstall. Feel free to install and activate to make a trial. However, you can choose to preserve plugin options after plugin delete/uninstall. For detailed uninstall info related to added WebP images, see the **FAQ** section below.


* **Privacy**
Warp iMagick Image Compressor plugin does not collect nor send any identifiable data from your server, without your consent. WordPress admin cookie is used to store admin-settings page-state (current tab & expanded sections). No external (Google) fonts are used.


* **Known conflicts**
Due to use of [bfi_thumb library](https://github.com/bfintal/bfi_thumb) which completely takes over wordpress WP_Image_Editor classes, in [Ajax Search Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ajax-search-lite/) plugin and in [Circles Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/circles-gallery/) plugin, Warp iMagick plugin may fail to activate while those plugins are active. Activating those plugins after Warp iMagick is activated, may cause malfunction. Plugin [WP Email Users](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-email-users/) (tested with version 1.7.6.) causes fatal submit error when saving Warp-iMagick settings.
Recognized known conflict will automatically issue administrator warning notice.

= How do I ‚Äúbulk compress‚Äù? =

To bulk (re)compress existing media images use [‚ÄúRegenerate Thumbnails Plugin‚Äù](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) or [‚ÄúWP CLI media regenerate‚Äù command](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/media/regenerate/).

= Do I need to keep ‚ÄòRegenerate Thumbnails‚Äô plugin? =

You don‚Äôt have to keep [‚ÄúRegenerate Thumbnails Plugin‚Äù](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin installed.

= Does this plugin support WooCommerce images? =

All image subsizes are supported, including any theme and/or WooCommerce specific image subsizes.

= How to serve converted WebP images? =

On the settings page, you will find instructions on how to configure server to redirect \*.jpg/\*.png to \*.jpg.webp/\*.png.webp and to deliver converted WebP images, if such image is generated by this plugin (file exists) and if visitor's browser suports WebP image format. Click on **HELP** at the top right of the plugin **SETTINGS PAGE**.

= How to modify Apache .htaccess configuration file? =

Use [**WP Htaccess Editor Plugin**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-htaccess-editor/) to safely modify your Apache .htaccess configuration file.

= Which PHP extensions are required by this plugin? =

1. PHP-Imagick to compress JPEG/PNG files (required).
2. PHP-GD to convert JPEG/PNG to WebP files (optional, but usually installed).

In order to modify/resize/crop photos or images, Wordpress requires at least PHP-GD. When both extensions are installed, WordPress prefers PHP-Imagick over PHP-GD.

= Do I have both required PHP extensions installed? =

1. WordPress 5.2 and above: Administrator: Menu -> Tools -> Site Health -> Info -> Expand "Media Handling" and check if "ImageMagick version string" and "GD version" have values.
2. WordPress 5.1 and below: Install [Health Check & Troubleshooting](https://wordpress.org/plugins/health-check/) plugin. Open "Health Check" plugin page and click on "PHP Information" tab. You will find there all PHP extensions installed and enabled. Search (Ctrl-F) on page for "Imagick" and "GD".
3. WordPress Editor class must be WP_Image_Editor_Imagick (or Warp_Image_Editor_Imagick) but **NOT** WP_Image_Editor_GD.
4. PHP-Imagick extension must be linked with ImageMagick library version **6.3.2** or newer.
5. PHP-GD extension version must be at least 2.0.0 to be accepted by WordPress Image Editor.

= Does my web hosting service provide PHP-Imagick and PHP-GD extensions? =

There is no excuse for hosting service providers not to allow or provide essential, free and open source PHP extensions. Both extensions are used by WordPress PHP code generating image subsizes and thumbnails!

See: [WordPress recommended PHP extensions](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/server-environment/#php-extensions)

1. A2 Hosting : [Yes, according to plugin 'A2 Optimized WP' description, Warp iMagick plugin is embraced and web server configuration for it is provided](https://wordpress.org/plugins/a2-optimized-wp/).
2. EasyWP     : [Yes, documentation page provided](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9697/2219/php-modules-and-extensions-on-shared-hosting-servers).
3. Hostpapa   : Yes, in cPanel. But may be not available in your hosting plan.
4. WPEngine   : Supposedly yes, but no web kb/help or documentation page found at the time of writting of this section.
5. Ask your hosting service provider support.

= How to install missing PHP-Imagick and PHP-GD extensions? =

1. [cPanel based hosting](https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/68Docs/PHP+Extensions+and+Applications+Package#PHPExtensionsandApplicationsPackage-PHPExtensionsandApplicationsPackageInstaller): Configuration may be not available in your hosting plan.
2. [Debian/Ubuntu using ssh access](https://deb.sury.org/): Via root user console, or prepend sudo to "apt install php-imagick php-gd".
3. [CentOS/RHEL/Fedora using ssh access](https://blog.remirepo.net/post/2019/12/03/Install-PHP-7.4-on-CentOS-RHEL-or-Fedora): "yum install php-imagick php-gd".
4. Ask your host-service provider support.

= Why WebP files have two extensions? =

To prevent overwriting duplicate "WebP" files. With single extension, when you upload "image.png" and "image.jpg", second "image.webp" would overwrite previous one.

= Why is WebP setting (checkbox) disabled? =

Because your server has no PHP-GD graphic editing extension or your PHP-GD extension has no WebP support.

= What happens with images when plugin is deactivated or deleted? =

1. Existing images remain optimized. If you run ["Regenerate Thumbnails"](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) batch process, after plugin is deactivated or deleted, batch process will restore original file-size and quality of WordPress thumbnails.
2. If you have WebP images, they won't be deleted. You can delete all WebP images while plugin is active. To delete WebP images, disable WebP option and then batch-run ["Regenerate Thumbnails"](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) for all media images.

= Why is plugin disabled and/or fails to activate? =

Because your server has no PHP-Imagick extension installed or has too old version of PHP-Imagick.
